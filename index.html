        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>I am an international student from China and this is my first time studying abroad, so I am still adjusting to life in Canada. I have made a lot of friends in Canada and I am very happy. Everything is new and I can see a very good future, I hope to stay in Canada and I will try my best.
        <p>I'm a bit introverted and I'm very formal the first time we meet, but once we continue to meet, I won't be so introverted, I'll make you happy, I'm good at making people happy and we'll have a great time together. Not to find trouble for yourself is my life credo.</p>
